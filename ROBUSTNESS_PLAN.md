# Prober Robustness Improvement Plan

This document outlines a 5-phase plan to improve the robustness and production-readiness of the email probe monitoring system.

## Implementation Order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

### Dependencies
- **Phase 1** provides configuration foundation for all other phases
- **Phase 2** can be implemented independently but benefits from Phase 1
- **Phase 3** integrates with Phase 2 (circuit breaker + backoff)
- **Phase 4** builds on Phase 3 (categorized errors enhance retry logic)  
- **Phase 5** can run parallel to Phase 4 but benefits from Phase 2's health system
